# project-Luca
Project-Luca is a fully open source machine learning program which will predict the next token when passed through

All recourses can be downloaded for free . you will be given total freedom to create custom apps or finetune the models. 
All datasets will be provided with the models too . you have complete freedom to train the model with additional data or with your tone of data . The architecture data will be open sourced
so you can finetune the models.
models will be trained on either a i5 12450H or a Nvidia RTX 3050 4GB

I wish one day I can collab with Sam Altman , so download my models and make some videos about it lol ðŸ¤«ðŸ˜‰
